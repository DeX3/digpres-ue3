\subsection{Export}\label{sec:export}

Because we used MongoDB as our database, it is straightforward to select JSON as the
format for our export. It is a nice, human-readable format that can be easily
exported by tools such as \texttt{mongoexport}:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ mongoexport --db github \
              --collection github-1433519125507 \
              --jsonArray \
              --out export.json
connected to: 127.0.0.1
exported 1000 records
\end{lstlisting}
